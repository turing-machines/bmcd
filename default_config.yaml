store:
  # The bmcd contains a write mechanism that writes its internal key/value store
  # back to the file-system. This happens on a timeout started from the last

authentication:
  # The amount of attempts a user can make before it get's an access denied

  # the access ban gets lifted again. Note that these bans are not persisted, a
  # restart of the daemon will reset the bookkeeping. Access denied penalty = 1
  # min to a maximum of 1024 min, or 17h.
